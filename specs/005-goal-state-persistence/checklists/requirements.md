# Specification Quality Checklist: Goal State & Persistence

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-08-22
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
  - Note: "Zig" appears once, under Assumptions, as the user-mandated implementation language (the means). Functional requirements and Success Criteria stay behavior-focused.
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- All checklist items pass. The specification is ready for `/skill:speckit-clarify` (optional) or `/skill:speckit-plan`.
- Delivers the Goal entity + explicit status state machine + persistence/reload/resume as a standalone, provider/agent-independent unit. Required by the autonomous goal execution feature (006) and the multi-window memory feature (008).
- Maximum clarification limit (3) was not triggered: status set, store abstraction, resume semantics, and concurrency rule are all specified or reasonably defaulted.
